# Le Jardin - Two Distinct Design Approaches

This project demonstrates how the same business (Le Jardin plant and flower shop) can have completely different website designs while maintaining consistent e-commerce functionality.

## Design Philosophies

### Design 1: Elegant Minimalism
Located in `designs/design-1`

- **Design Language**: Classic, elegant, and refined with plenty of white space
- **Typography**: Serif fonts (Playfair Display) for headings, light sans-serif for body text
- **Color Palette**: Emerald green as primary color with neutral stone backgrounds
- **Layout Structure**: Traditional grid-based layout with clear sections
- **UI Elements**: Clean borders, subtle hover effects, rectangular buttons
- **Content Flow**: Structured, predictable hierarchy with formal tone
- **Visual Style**: Sophisticated photography with ample negative space

### Design 2: Vibrant Playfulness  
Located in `designs/design-2`

- **Design Language**: Modern, playful, and bold with organic shapes
- **Typography**: Sans-serif (Montserrat) with varied weights for contrast
- **Color Palette**: Bright rose and lime with warm amber background
- **Layout Structure**: Dynamic layout with overlapping elements, asymmetry
- **UI Elements**: Rounded corners, floating elements, circular buttons
- **Content Flow**: More casual, engaging, conversational style
- **Visual Style**: Bold colors, playful geometry, immersive imagery

## Same Business, Different Experiences

Despite the dramatically different visual approaches, both designs effectively:
- Showcase the plant and flower products
- Provide store information (location, hours)
- Include e-commerce functionality (product listings, cart)
- Feature customer testimonials
- Offer newsletter signup
- Incorporate social media
- Maintain brand identity (Le Jardin)

These designs illustrate how AI-generated websites can create truly unique experiences tailored to the seller's brand personality and target audience, while still incorporating standard e-commerce patterns and functionality.
